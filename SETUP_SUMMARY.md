# User Dashboard Backend Setup - Summary

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Models (Backend/model/)
Created four new Mongoose models to support the user dashboard:

- **User.model.js** - Extended with:
  - `name`, `email`, `profileImage` fields
  - References to `hatcheries` and `notifications`

- **Hatchery.model.js** (NEW) - Stores hatchery information:
  - Title, current day, total days
  - Status (pending/accepted/declined)
  - Thumbnail, upload tracking
  - References to uploads

- **Upload.model.js** (NEW) - Stores uploaded images:
  - Day range (e.g., "Day 1-10")
  - Image URL, status
  - Admin comments
  - References to hatchery and user

- **Notification.model.js** (NEW) - Stores user notifications:
  - Type (accepted/rejected/comment)
  - Message, comment, read status
  - References to related upload

### 2. Backend Controller (Backend/controllers/)
Created **UserDashboard.controller.js** with 10 endpoints:

#### User Profile Management
- `getUserProfile` - Get user profile with hatcheries and notifications
- `updateUserProfile` - Update name, email, profile image

#### Hatchery Management
- `getUserHatcheries` - Get all user's hatcheries with uploads
- `createHatchery` - Create new hatchery
- `getHatcheryUploads` - Get all uploads for a hatchery

#### Upload Management
- `createUpload` - Create new upload for a hatchery
- `deleteUpload` - Delete an upload

#### Notifications
- `getUserNotifications` - Get all user notifications
- `markNotificationRead` - Mark notification as read

#### Statistics
- `getDashboardStats` - Get dashboard statistics (counts, unread notifications)

### 3. Backend Routes (Backend/routes/)
Created **UserDashboard.route.js** with RESTful routes:
```
GET    /api/user/:phoneNumber/profile
PUT    /api/user/:phoneNumber/profile
GET    /api/user/:phoneNumber/hatcheries
POST   /api/user/:phoneNumber/hatcheries
GET    /api/hatchery/:hatcheryId/uploads
POST   /api/user/:phoneNumber/uploads
DELETE /api/upload/:uploadId
GET    /api/user/:phoneNumber/notifications
PUT    /api/notification/:notificationId/read
GET    /api/user/:phoneNumber/stats
```

### 4. Server Configuration (Backend/server.js)
Updated with:
- CORS middleware for frontend connectivity
- express.urlencoded middleware for form data
- Registered user dashboard routes
- Removed deprecated Mongoose options

### 5. Frontend API Service (Frontend/src/services/)
Created **api.js** with:
- Centralized API configuration
- Helper functions for all backend endpoints
- Error handling with consistent response format
- Image upload helper (placeholder for cloud storage)

### 6. Frontend Integration (Frontend/src/Components/)
Updated **UserDashboard.jsx** with:
- API integration via useEffect hooks
- Automatic data fetching on component mount
- Profile image upload with backend sync
- Upload confirmation with backend storage
- Error handling and loading states

Updated **UserLogin.jsx** with:
- Saves phone number to localStorage on successful login
- Phone number is used as user identifier in dashboard

```

## How to Run

### Backend
```bash
cd Backend
npm install          # Install dependencies (cors was added)
node server.js       # Start server on port 3000
```

### Frontend
```bash
cd Frontend
npm install
npm run dev         # Start Vite dev server
```

## Testing the Integration

### 1. User Login
- Navigate to `/user-login`
- Enter phone number and get OTP
- Upon successful login, phone number is saved to localStorage

### 2. User Dashboard
- After login, you're redirected to `/user-dashboard`
- Dashboard automatically fetches:
  - User profile
  - Hatcheries
  - Notifications
  - Statistics

### 3. API Testing
You can test the backend APIs directly using tools like Postman or curl:

```bash
# Get user profile
curl http://localhost:3000/api/user/9876543210/profile

# Create hatchery
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/user/9876543210/hatcheries \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title": "Pond #1", "thumbnail": "url"}'

# Get dashboard stats
curl http://localhost:3000/api/user/9876543210/stats
```

## Next Steps / Enhancements

### Image Upload
Currently using placeholder function. Implement:

- Or other cloud storage service

Example Cloudinary setup in `api.js`:
```javascript
const CLOUDINARY_URL = 'https://api.cloudinary.com/v1_1/YOUR_CLOUD_NAME/upload';
const CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET = 'YOUR_PRESET';
```

- Add authentication middleware to routes
- Store tokens in localStorage or cookies

### Real-time Updates
- Add Socket.io for real-time notifications
- Live status updates for uploads
- Push notifications

### Pagination
- Implement pagination for hatcheries list
- Pagination for notifications
- Load more / infinite scroll

### Search & Filters
Backend support for:
- Search hatcheries by title
- Filter by status
- Date range filtering

### Admin Dashboard
- Admin APIs to approve/reject uploads
- Add comments to uploads
- Send notifications to users

## Dependencies Added

### Backend
- `cors` - Cross-Origin Resource Sharing for frontend connectivity

### Frontend
- No new dependencies (uses existing fetch API)

## Environment Variables

### Backend (.env)
```
DBurl=mongodb://localhost:27017/Hatch_track
# or MongoDB Atlas connection string
```

## API Documentation
See [USER_DASHBOARD_API.md](Backend/USER_DASHBOARD_API.md) for complete API documentation including:
- All endpoints with examples
- Request/response formats
- Model schemas
- Usage examples

## Important Notes

1. **Phone Number Format**: Currently accepts any format. Consider standardizing (e.g., +91XXXXXXXXXX)

2. **Image Storage**: The `uploadImageToCloudinary` function is a placeholder that returns base64 data URLs. This works for testing but should be replaced with actual cloud storage in production.

3. **Error Handling**: Basic error handling is implemented. Consider adding:
   - More specific error messages
   - Error logging service
   - User-friendly error pages

4. **Data Validation**: Basic validation exists. Consider adding:
   - Input sanitization
   - Schema validation (Joi, Yup)
   - Rate limiting

5. **Security**: Add in production:
   - JWT authentication
   - API rate limiting
   - Input validation
   - XSS protection
   - CSRF tokens

6. **Performance**: Consider:
   - Database indexing on frequently queried fields
   - Caching with Redis
   - Compression middleware
   - CDN for images

## Troubleshooting

### Backend won't start
- Check if MongoDB is running
- Verify `.env` file exists with correct `DBurl`
- Check if port 3000 is available

### Frontend can't connect to backend
- Verify backend is running on port 3000
- Check CORS is enabled in server.js
- Verify API_BASE_URL in api.js is correct

### Data not loading in dashboard
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify phone number is in localStorage
- Test API endpoints directly with curl/Postman
- Check MongoDB has the user record

## Success! ðŸŽ‰

The user dashboard backend is now fully set up and connected to the frontend. Users can:
- View their profile
- See their hatcheries
- Upload images for growth tracking
- Receive notifications
- View dashboard statistics

All data is persisted in MongoDB and accessible via RESTful APIs.
